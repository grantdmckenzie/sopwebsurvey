This survey will take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete.  As a token of our appreciation of your time and participation in this survey, you will receive a <b>$10 gift certificate per person.</b>  <br>
    <center>To participate in this survey, please visit<br><a href="https://transportation.geog.ucsb.edu">https://transportation.geog.ucsb.edu</a></center> <p align="center" style="font-weight:100"><u>Please have each member of your household register and complete a separate survey.</u><br> </br></p> 
    <font color="#383838" size="4"><center> <b>Why does this survey matter? </b></font></center>
    <p align="center" style="font-weight:100"><font color="#383838" size="3"> Participating in activities at different times and in different geographic places is a part of daily life. As a result of the need or desire to participate in activities, we need to use some form of transportation to get ourselves and others to those activities. In order to accommodate the requirements of the daily lives of people, city planners and policy makers use a toolbox of sophisticated techniques to understand the behavior of individuals, to design transportation infrastructure and policies accordingly.  Among those tools in the toolbox are highly detailed, computational models (representations) of behavior. In order to develop these models, data is needed to provide details about the "whens," "wheres," "whats" and "hows" of everyday time use and travel. </font> </p>
