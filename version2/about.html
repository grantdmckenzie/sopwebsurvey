As a result of the need or desire to participate in activities, we need to use some form of transportation to get ourselves and others to those activities. In order to accomodate the requirements of the daily lives of people, city planners and policy makers use a toolbox of sophisticated techniques to understand the behavior of individuals, and design transportation infrastructure and policies accordingly.</font></td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among those tools in the toolbox are highly detailed, computational models (representations) of behavior.  In order to develop these models, data is needed to provide details about the whens, wheres and hows of everyday time use and travel.  As researchers, it is our goal to increase the detail and accuracy of these behavioral representations.  By using sophisticated statistical methods, we can understand differences between people and determine if aspects such as stages of life (student, married, being a parent, retired, etc), or gender influence those whens, wheres and hows of daily activities, and how those decisions get made.</font></td></tr>
