If you have already completed the survey, thank you very much for your time.  If you have yet to complete it, <b>each member</b> of your household (age 18 and above) is being asked to take part in this research survey.   This survey will take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete, and can be completed all at once, or in smaller portions as you are able.  As a token of our appreciation of your time and participation in this survey, you will receive a <b>$10 gift certificate per person </b>(through www.giftrocket.com), after completing the survey (up to $40 per household).  <br>
    <center>To participate in this survey, please visit<br><a href="https://transportation.geog.ucsb.edu">https://transportation.geog.ucsb.edu</a></center> <p align="center" style="font-weight:200"><i>by June 30, 2012.</i><br> </br></p> 
    <font color="#383838" size="4"><center> <b>Why does this survey matter? </b></font></center>
    <p align="center" style="font-weight:100"><font color="#383838" size="3"> Participating in activities at different times and in different geographic places is a part of daily life. As a result of the need or desire to participate in activities, we use transportation to get ourselves and others to those activities. In order to accommodate the requirements of the daily lives of people, city planners and policy makers use a toolbox of sophisticated techniques to understand the behavior of individuals, to design transportation infrastructure and policies accordingly.  Among those tools in the toolbox are highly detailed, computational models (representations) of behavior. In order to develop these models, data is needed to provide details about the "whens," "wheres," "whats" and "hows" of everyday time use and travel.  Your participation makes a difference in our understanding of everyday behavior, and will help us create better planning tools to plan for transportation needs! </font> </p>
