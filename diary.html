As a result of the need or desire to participate in activities, we need to use some form of transportation to get ourselves and others to those activities. In order to accomodate the requirements of the daily lives of people, city planners and policy makers use a toolbox of sophisticated techniques to understand the behavior of individuals, to design transportation infrastructure and policies accordingly.  Among those tools in the toolbox are highly detailed, computational models (representations) of behavior. In order to develop these models, data is needed to provide details about the "whens," "wheres," "whats" and "hows" of everyday time use and travel.</font><br> 
<br></p>
       <p><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, you may be asking yourself "Why do you need to know what I did the entire day?  Aren't you just interested in transportation?"  This is a great question.  Our computational models involve creating a schedule for each person in the area we are interested in.  We start off with the things in life that require a person to get from point "a" to point "b", and then simulate their travel.  The goal is to have the most accurate representation of the demand on transportation infrastructure and environmental impact.  In order to do this, we need a sample from a diverse group of people during a variety of daily scenarios, so we can make sure to include the intracasies of daily life.  Your data is important to us to make this research as accurate as possible!!!</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  research project involves logging your activities and details of your activities in a diary and reporting these activities online.  You will be asked to report these activities for one week, providing information about the start and end times of your activities, who you were with, what the activity consisted of, and details of the decision making involved in conducting these activities.</font> <br>
