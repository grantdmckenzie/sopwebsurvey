Online Social Network Activities
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating in activities at different times and in different geographic places is a part of daily life. As a result of the need or desire to participate in activities, we need to use some form of transportation to get ourselves and others to those activities. In order to accomodate the requirements of the daily lives of people, city planners and policy makers use a toolbox of sophisticated techniques to understand the behavior of individuals, to design transportation infrastructure and policies accordingly. Among those tools in the toolbox are highly detailed, computational models (representations) of behavior. In order to develop these models, data is needed to provide details about the "whens," "wheres," "whats" and "hows" of everyday time use and travel.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, you may be asking yourself "Why do you need to know what I did the entire day? Aren't you just interested in transportation?" This is a great question. Our computational models involve creating a schedule for each person in the area we are interested in. We start off with the things in life that require a person to get from point "a" to point "b", and then simulate their travel. The goal is to have the most accurate representation of the demand on transportation infrastructure and environmental impact. In order to do this, we need a sample from a diverse group of people during a variety of daily scenarios, so we can make sure to include the intracasies of daily life. Your data is important to us to make this research as accurate as possible!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this study is to examine the role of online social networks in predicting users' real-world activities.  Through this study we hope to provide valuable insight into the link between online interactions and real-world activities.  The results of this study aim to augment current mobile location based services, enhance emergency response tactics and improve intelligence and security models.  The study will involve accessing social data from your online social network platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare etc).  The data gathered will be no different than any of the information your <i>Friends</i> have access too and will only involve the data you are comfortable sharing.
